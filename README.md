# lambda

Experimental repo for testing tech, frameworks, and random ideas.

## What is this?

A personal lab for:

- Trying out new libraries
- Quick prototypes
- Playing with weird stacks

Basically a digital sketchbook.

## Structure
None. Itâ€™s chaotic by design.

Expect broken things, half-baked features, some really cool stuff and spontaneous rewrites.
