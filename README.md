# lambda

ðŸš§ Experimental playground for testing new tech, frameworks, and fun ideas.

---

## What is this?

`lambda` is a personal lab, a repo where I experiment with:

- New libraries and frameworks
- Rapid prototypes of small ideas
- Weird but interesting tech stacks

Think of it as a digital sketchbook.

---

## Structure

No strict rules. Some folders may contain:
- Full-stack app experiments
- Frontend component ideas
- Backend service POCs
- CLI tools
- Integration tests with new APIs

It will probably look chaotic â€” and thatâ€™s the point.

## Disclaimer

Expect broken things, half-baked features, cool stuff and spontaneous rewrites.
